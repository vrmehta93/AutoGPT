Running in devcontainer
    Use Python 3.12

I get an error:
```

During handling of the above exception, another exception occurred:

Everything seemed fine:

Install `uvicorn` but it also seems that there's needs to be benchmark

```
vscode âžœ /workspaces/AutoGPT/classic (master) $ ./run benchmark start TEST_AGENT_1
ðŸš€ Running benchmark for 'TEST_AGENT_1' with subprocess arguments: 
vscode âžœ /workspaces/AutoGPT/classic (master) $ Path /workspaces/AutoGPT/classic/agents/benchmark for agbenchmark does not exist
Command not found: agbenchmark
```

`pip install agbenchmark`

Now I get different error:

```
vscode âžœ /workspaces/AutoGPT/classic (master) $ ./run benchmark start TEST_AGENT_1
ðŸš€ Running benchmark for 'TEST_AGENT_1' with subprocess arguments: 
vscode âžœ /workspaces/AutoGPT/classic (master) $ Path /workspaces/AutoGPT/classic/agents/benchmark for agbenchmark does not exist
Usage: agbenchmark [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...

Options:

Commands:
  serve
  start
  version  Print the version of the benchmark tool.
^C
```

From discord:
 in pyproject.toml 
it's a relative path so if you have your agent in agents/{your_agent_name} you should change line 12 from
`agbenchmark = { path = "../benchmark", optional = true }`
to
`agbenchmark = { path = "../../benchmark", optional = true }`

After that, benchmark still gave the same issue but without the agbenchmark error

I ran start command, it complained `primp` can't be installed since I don't have cargo and rust. To install those:
```
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
source $HOME/.cargo/env
rustc --version
cargo --version
```

Then I ran start again and now it complained about primp again for not having google logging module:  
So I ran `pip install google-cloud-logging`

I tried to install `primp` with `pip wheel --no-cache-dir --use-pep517 "primp==0.6.3"` from TEST_AGENT_1 directory but it's complaining again I don't have cmake:
```
failed to execute command: No such file or directory (os error 2)
is `cmake` not installed?
```
To install `cmake`:
```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install cmake
```
